# Sympto-AI-Checker-ML Project

**An AI-powered Symptom Checker application developed using Python and machine learning algorithms for the early detection of common diseases. The system provides users with potential disease predictions based on reported symptoms, guiding them toward appropriate medical advice.**

## **Features**

- Symptom-Based Disease Prediction using Decision Trees and Random Forests.
- User-Friendly Interface through a command-line or optional Flask web interface.
- Efficient Data Processing with Pandas and NumPy.
- Insightful Visualizations of prediction results using Matplotlib or Seaborn.

## **Tech Stack**

- Programming Language: Python
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn (Decision Trees, Random Forest)
- Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
- Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- User Interface: Command-line / Flask (optional)
